### Economic Conditions
To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our shareholders, while the incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations. Such debt instruments also could introduce covenants that might restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that we could obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.

### Technology
We continue to evaluate our real estate footprint to optimize our global office space while making necessary investments in offices and information technology infrastructure to grow our business. We find these investments using current cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow from operations. Given the impact of our Work From Anywhere program and in conjunction with a strategic review of our real estate footprint and space utilization trends, our focus has shifted more towards optimizing our current portfolio and reviewing our real estate needs around the world as opposed to significant expansions of our presence in current markets. This has resulted in a reduction of our real estate footprint as we have decided to sublease certain leased office space.

### Share Repurchase Program
On August 20, 2021, the Company announced that the board of directors had approved a program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s ordinary shares. Repurchases of up to 10,000,000 of the Company's ordinary shares were authorized at the Company's general meeting of shareholders on April 21, 2021. The share repurchase program will expire on April 21, 2026. Since the commencement of this repurchase program and through September 30, 2024, 469,274 ordinary shares were repurchased for €999 million under this program.

The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and growth investment opportunities. The repurchase program is executed consistent with the Company’s capital allocation strategy of prioritizing investment to repurchase business over the long term. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of ordinary shares, and the actual proceeds may vary based on the discretion and initiative at any time at the Company’s discretion. The Company uses current cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow it generates from operations to fund the share repurchase program.
