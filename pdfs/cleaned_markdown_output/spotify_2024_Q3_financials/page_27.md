The fair value of the Exchangeable Notes was estimated using a combination of a binomial option pricing model and prices observed for the Exchangeable Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the reporting period. A weight of 50% was applied to the binomial option pricing model and a weight of 50% was applied to the price of the Exchangeable Notes in the over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the period. The key assumptions used in the binomial option pricing model for the Exchangeable Notes were as follows:

| Risk free rate (%) | Discount rate (%) | Volatility (%) | Share price (USS) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.83% | 5.85 % | 40 % | 368.53 |

A decrease or increase of 10 percentage points in volatility would have resulted in a fair value of the Exchangeable Notes ranging from £1,318 million to £1,363 million at September 30, 2024. A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price would have resulted in a fair value of the Exchangeable Notes ranging from £1,323 million to £1,361 million at September 30, 2024. A decrease or increase of 100 basis points in credit spread would have resulted in a fair value of the Exchangeable Notes ranging from £1,347 million to £1,333 million at September 30, 2024.
