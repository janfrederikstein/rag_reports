## Long term investments - other

The Group has interests in certain long term investments, the most significant of which is our equity investment in DistroKid, an independent digital music distribution service. These long term investments primarily represent unlisted equity securities carried at fair value through other comprehensive income/(loss). The fair values of these equity investments are generally determined using business enterprises valued on market transactions or by applying market multiples to the projected financial performance and discounting the future value to its present base equivalent. The key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these equity investments include market multiples of revenue or earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies used to estimate business enterprise value and discount rate.

The fair value of the long term investments may vary over time and is subject to a variety of risks including company performance, macroeconomic, regulatory, industry, USD to Euro exchange rate, and systemic risks of the overall equity markets.
