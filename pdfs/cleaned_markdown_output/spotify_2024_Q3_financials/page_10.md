### 2. Basis of preparation and summary of material accounting policies

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Spotify Technology S.A. for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). The interim financial information is unaudited. The interim financial information reflects all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the information for the year herein. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Group's consolidated financial statements set forth herein and December 31, 2023, as they do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual consolidated financial statements. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of Euros.

### New and amended standards and interpretations adopted by the Group

#### Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants - Amendments to IAS 1

On January 1, 2024, the Group adopted the latest IASB issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments are applied on a retrospective basis and require the Group to reclassify the Exchangeable Notes (as defined below) as a current liability if the exchange conditions are met, even if no noteholder actually requires us to exchange their notes. Adoption of this amendment did not result in the reclassification of the Exchangeable Notes as a current liability at any reporting date, from the inception of the Exchangeable Notes to September 30, 2024, as the exchange conditions had not been met.

There are no other new International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) or IFRS Interpretation Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations effective during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have a material impact to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

### New standards and interpretations issued not yet effective

#### Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements - IFRS 18

In April 2024, the IASB issued IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (“IFRS 18”) which replaces IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. IFRS 18 requires an entity to classify all income and expenses within its statement of profit or loss into one of five categories: operating; investing; financing; income taxes; and discontinued operations. The first three categories are new. These categories are complemented by the requirement to present subtotals and totals for "operating profit or loss," “profit or loss before financing income and taxes,” and “profit or loss.” IFRS 18, and the amendments to the other standards, is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2027, but earlier application is permitted. The Group is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard.
