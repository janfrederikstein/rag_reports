### Recurring Fair Value Measurements

The Group's approximate 8% investment in TME is carried at fair value through other comprehensive income/(loss). The fair value of the investment in TME may vary over time and is subject to a variety of risks including company performance, macro-economic, regulatory, industry, USD to Euro exchange rate and systemic risks of the equity markets overall.

The table below presents the changes in the investment in TME:

| Date         | 2024        | 2023        |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| At January 1 | 1,154       | 1,094       |
| Changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive (loss)/income | 376         | (241)       |
| At September 30 | 1,530      | 853         |

A 10% decrease or increase in TME's share price would have resulted in a fair value of the Group's long term investment in TME ranging from €1,377 million to €1,684 million at September 30, 2024.
