For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Premium revenue increased €1,718 million, or 20%.

#### Ad-Supported revenue

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Ad-Supported revenue comprised 12% and 13% of our total revenue, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, Ad-Supported revenue increased €25 million, or 6%. This increase was due primarily to growth in impressions sold, which increased revenue from programmatic channels and our self-serve platform by €15 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

For both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Ad-Supported revenue comprised 12% of our total revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Ad-Supported revenue increased €137 million, or 12%. The increase was due primarily to growth in music impressions sold, which increased revenue in our direct and programmatic channels as well as our self-serve platform by €91 million. The remaining increase was due primarily to growth in podcast impressions sold and marketplace programs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

#### Foreign exchange impact on total revenue

The general movement of the Euro relative to certain foreign currencies, as well as movement in the Argentine Peso, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, had an unfavorable net impact on our revenue. We estimate that total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have been approximately €91 million and €185 million higher, respectively, if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with foreign exchange rates for the comparable period in 2023.
