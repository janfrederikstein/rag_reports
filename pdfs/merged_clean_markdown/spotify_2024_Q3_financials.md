## Notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements
**(Unaudited)**

### 1. Corporate information

Spotify Technology S.A. (the “Company” or “parent”) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in Luxembourg. The Company's registered office is 33 Boulevard Prince Henri, L-1724 Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is audio streaming. The Group’s premium service (“Premium Service”) provides users with unlimited online and offline high-quality streaming access to its catalog of music and podcasts. In select markets, the Premium Service provides eligible users with limited online and offline streaming access to its catalog of audiobooks. The Premium Service offers a music listening experience without commercial breaks. The Group’s ad-supported service (“Ad-Supported Service”) and together with the Premium Service and other subscription offerings, the “Service”) has no subscription fees and provides users with limited on-demand online access to the catalog of music and unlimited online and offline access to the catalog of podcasts. The Group depends on securing content licenses from a number of major and minor content owners and other rights holders in order to provide its service.

### 2. Basis of preparation and summary of material accounting policies

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Spotify Technology S.A. for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). The interim financial information is unaudited. The interim financial information reflects all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the information for the year herein. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Group's consolidated financial statements set forth herein and December 31, 2023, as they do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual consolidated financial statements. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of Euros.

### New and amended standards and interpretations adopted by the Group

#### Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants - Amendments to IAS 1

On January 1, 2024, the Group adopted the latest IASB issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments are applied on a retrospective basis and require the Group to reclassify the Exchangeable Notes (as defined below) as a current liability if the exchange conditions are met, even if no noteholder actually requires us to exchange their notes. Adoption of this amendment did not result in the reclassification of the Exchangeable Notes as a current liability at any reporting date, from the inception of the Exchangeable Notes to September 30, 2024, as the exchange conditions had not been met.

There are no other new International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) or IFRS Interpretation Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations effective during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have a material impact to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

### New standards and interpretations issued not yet effective

#### Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements - IFRS 18

In April 2024, the IASB issued IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (“IFRS 18”) which replaces IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. IFRS 18 requires an entity to classify all income and expenses within its statement of profit or loss into one of five categories: operating; investing; financing; income taxes; and discontinued operations. The first three categories are new. These categories are complemented by the requirement to present subtotals and totals for "operating profit or loss," “profit or loss before financing income and taxes,” and “profit or loss.” IFRS 18, and the amendments to the other standards, is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2027, but earlier application is permitted. The Group is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard.

# Page 11

## Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments - Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7

In May 2024, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7, Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments. The amendments clarify that a financial liability is derecognized on the “settlement date,” which is when the related obligation is discharged, canceled, expired or the liability otherwise qualifies for derecognition. The amendments also clarify how to assess the contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets that include environmental, social, and governance ("ESG")-linked features and other similar contingent features, and the treatment of non-recourse assets and contractually linked instruments. In addition, the amendments require additional disclosures in IFRS 7 for financial assets and liabilities with contractual terms that reference a contingent event (including those that are ESG-linked), and equity instruments classified at fair value through other comprehensive income. The amendments will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2026, but earlier application is permitted. The Group is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments.

There are no other IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective and that are expected to have a material impact to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

## 3. Critical accounting estimates and judgments

In preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the significant judgments made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation and uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events.

## 5. Income tax

The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 24.5% and 10.9%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 8.4% and 23.4%, respectively. The Group operates in a global environment with significant operations in various jurisdictions outside Luxembourg. Accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the Group's earnings and the applicable tax rates in the jurisdictions where the Group operates.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense was €98 million. €70 million of current income tax expense was primarily related to profitability within the Group and did not reflect a €50 million excess tax benefit of share-based compensation deductions recognized in equity. In addition, €27 million of deferred tax expense was primarily related to

## Table of Contents

### Earnings Analysis

- For the three months ending September 30, 2024, the **Group** recorded a tax expense of €88 million, where €12 million of current income tax expense was attributed to subsidiaries within a taxable profit within the Group. However, a net operating loss carryforward reduced recordable profits by assets primarily related to the music entertainment group due to a decrease in unrealized gain on long-term investment.

- Notably, for the nine months ending September 30, 2024, the total income tax expense was dramatically higher at €171 million, yet €150 million of current income tax expense was incurred, partly offset by a €114 million deferred tax benefit from share-based compensation and €27 million from deferred tax expense related to recognition of net deferred tax assets.

### Comprehensive Income

- Income and losses that are not reflected in the net income were reported separately, under other comprehensive (loss)/income. Deferred tax assets and bases compensation deductions in equity notably influenced these figures.

### Regulatory Challenges and Financial Projections

- The **Group** is subject to the OECD's Pillar 2 Model Rules ("P2 Rules"), which have been substantively enacted but have not materially affected the current financial statements. The potential tax exposure regarding these rules is continually evaluated for material impact, particularly focusing on jurisdictions such as Luxembourg and Sweden.

- The likelihood of audit outcomes in different jurisdictions and their impact on tax positions is constantly monitored, reflecting uncertainty in regulatory landscapes and possible obligations due in near future.

### Asset Evaluation

- For the timeframe ending December 31, 2023, deferred tax assets valued at €721 million and €762 million show significant potential due to the recognition of deducible temporary differences and net operating loss carry-forwards, mainly in Sweden. This reflects a robust assessment of future taxable profits and management's strategic tax position planning.

### Performance Metrics

- **Net Deferred Tax Assets**: Notable increases in tax assets were recorded between September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, primarily due to reevaluation of the probability of utilizing deferred tax assets, representing a comprehensive analysis of fiscal potential and existing tax strategies.

### Earnings per Share (EPS) Computation

- Basic and diluted earnings per share calculations were conducted using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period, inclusive of options, warrants, and Exchangeable Notes. Adjustments were made for dilutive effects where applicable during the period, orienting towards shareholder value management and stock market performance evaluations.

## Lease Liabilities

### Maturity Analysis
- Less than one year: 101
- One to five years: 321
- More than five years: 249
- **Total lease commitments: 671**
- _Impact of discounting remaining lease payments: (157)_
- **Total lease liabilities: 514**

### Lease liabilities included in the interim condensed consolidated statement of financial position
- Current: 68
- Non-current: 446
- **Total: 514**

Excluded from the lease commitments above are short term leases. Expenses relating to short term leases were approximately €1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and €3 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, the Group has entered into certain lease agreements with approximately €40 million of commitments, which had not commenced as of September 30, 2024, and, as such, have not been recognized in the interim condensed consolidated statement of financial position.

The weighted-average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities recognized in the interim condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of September 30, 2024 was 6.4%.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Group entered into agreements to sublease a portion of its leased offices under finance leases. As an intermediate lessor, the Group accounts for sublease arrangements separately from the related lease agreements. Subleases are classified as either finance or operating leases by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease. Where the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease; all other leases are classified as operating leases. Amounts due from lessees under finance subleases are recognized as receivables discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease.

### Exchangeable Notes
On March 2, 2021, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Spotify USA Inc. (the “Issuer”), issued US$1,500 million aggregate principal amount of 0% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Exchangeable Notes”), which included the initial purchasers’ exercise in full of their option to purchase an additional US$200 million principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes. The Exchangeable Notes will mature on March 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or exchanged. The Exchangeable Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis by the Company. The transaction costs were immediately expensed and included in finance costs in the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021.

The Exchangeable Notes are the Issuer’s senior unsecured obligations and are equally subordinated to that with the Issuer's future and seniority-subordinated, senior in right of payment to the Issuer’s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Exchangeable Notes and effectively indentedness, to the Issuer’s future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the payment indebisness. The Exchangeable Notes will be structurally subordinated to all future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and to the extent the Issuer is not a holder thereof preferred equity, if any, of the Issuer’s subsidiaries.

The noteholders may exchange their Exchangeable Notes at their option under certain circumstances that, at the Issuer’s election, of ordinary events of the Company, or a combination of cash and ordinary shares, but only into consideration certain conversions as set forth in the indenture governing the Exchangeable Notes (the “Indenture”). The circumstances required to allow the noteholders to exchange their Exchangeable Notes were not met during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The Exchangeable Notes were not redeemable prior to March 20, 2024, except in the event of certain tax law changes as set forth in the Indenture. As of March 20, 2024, the Exchangeable Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Issuer’s option at any time, and from time to time, on and or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any, but only if the last reported sale price per ordinary share exceeds 130% of the exchange price on:

1. each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Issuer sends the related redemption notice; and
2. the trading day immediately before the date the Issuer sends such notice.

In addition, the Issuer will have the right to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Exchangeable Notes if certain changes in tax law as set forth in the Indenture occur. In addition, calling any Exchangeable Note for redemption will constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to that Exchangeable Note, in which case the exchange rate applicable to the exchange of that Exchangeable Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is exchanged after it is called for redemption.

Upon the occurrence of a “fundamental change” as set forth in the Indenture, noteholders may require the Issuer to repurchase their Exchangeable Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any, to but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date as set forth in the Indenture.

The Group accounted for the Exchangeable Notes at fair value through profit and loss using the fair value option in accordance with IFRS 9, Financial Instruments. The fair value of the Exchangeable Notes as of September 30, 2024 was.

Various legal actions, proceedings, and claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted against the Group. The results of such legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the extent of the Group's financial exposure is difficult to estimate. The Group records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

As of April 2019, Spotify USA Inc.'s settlement of the Fredrik et al. v. Spotify USA Inc., putative class action lawsuit, which alleged that Spotify USA Inc. unlawfully reproduced and distributed musical compositions without obtaining licenses, was final and effective. Even with the effectiveness of the settlement, we may still be subject to claims of copyright infringement by rights holders who have purported to opt out of the settlement or who may not otherwise be covered by its terms. The Music Modernization Act of 2018 contains a limitation of liability with respect to such lawsuits. For example, in January 2019, the Rights Holders LLC, nevertheless, filed lawsuits, and may argue that they should not be bound by this limitation of liability filed on or after August 1, 2018. Eight Mile Style, LLC et al. v. Spotify USA Inc., lawsuit was filed against Spotify USA Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, alleging both that Spotify USA Inc. does not qualify for the limitation of liability in the Music Modernization Act and that the limitation of liability is unconstitutional and, thus, not valid law. In August 2024, the court granted partial summary judgment for Spotify USA Inc. against Eight Mile Style, LLC, holding that all of Eight Mile Style’s claims are barred. Eight Mile Style has filed a notice of appeal.

## 19. Financial instruments

### Foreign exchange forward contracts

#### Cash flow hedges

The Group's currency pairs used for cash flow hedges are Euro / U.S. dollar, Euro / Australian dollar, Euro / British pound, Euro / Swedish krona, Euro / Canadian dollar, and Euro / Norwegian krone. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts hedging the revenue and cost of revenue line items in the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations was approximately €1,568 million and €1,003 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024, and approximately €1,414 million and €991 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023.

#### Fair values

The carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, restricted cash, trade and other payables, and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities. The Group measures its finance lease receivables as described in Note 7. The carrying amount of our finance lease receivables is considered to approximate their fair value at September 30, 2024. Refer to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 for information regarding the Group's measurement of its lease liabilities. All other financial assets and liabilities are accounted for at fair value.

### Recurring Fair Value Measurements

**Long term investment - Tencent Music Entertainment Group**

The Group's approximate 8% investment in TME is carried at fair value through other comprehensive income/(loss). The fair value of the investment in TME may vary over time and is subject to a variety of risks including company performance, macro-economic, regulatory, industry, USD to Euro exchange rate and systemic risks of the equity markets overall.

The table below presents the changes in the investment in TME:

| Date         | 2024        | 2023        |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| At January 1 | 1,154       | 1,094       |
| Changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive (loss)/income | 376         | (241)       |
| At September 30 | 1,530      | 853         |

A 10% decrease or increase in TME's share price would have resulted in a fair value of the Group's long term investment in TME ranging from €1,377 million to €1,684 million at September 30, 2024.

The following sections describe the valuation methodologies the Group uses to measure its Level 3 financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis.

## Long term investments - other

The Group has interests in certain long term investments, the most significant of which is our equity investment in DistroKid, an independent digital music distribution service. These long term investments primarily represent unlisted equity securities carried at fair value through other comprehensive income/(loss). The fair values of these equity investments are generally determined using business enterprises valued on market transactions or by (i) applying market multiples to the projected financial performance and (ii) discounting the future value to its present base equivalent. The key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these equity investments include market multiples of revenue or earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies used to estimate business enterprise value and discount rate.

The fair value of the long term investments may vary over time and is subject to a variety of risks including company performance, macroeconomic, regulatory, industry, USD to Euro exchange rate, and systemic risks of the overall equity markets.

The table below presents the changes in the other long term investments:

| At January 1 | 2024 | 2023 |

## Warrants

On July 25, 2024, the Company issued 118,891 ordinary shares and 1,188,910 beneficiary certificates to Daniel Ek, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, through D.G.E. Investments Limited, an entity indirectly wholly owned by him, upon the net settlement of the 800,000 warrants that were granted on August 23, 2021.

As of September 30, 2024 there were no outstanding warrants and as of December 31, 2023, the number of outstanding warrants was 800,000.

The table below presents the changes in the warrants liability:

| At January 1 | 2024 | 2023 |
|----------------|------|------|
| Changes in fair value recognized in interim condensed consolidated statement of operations | 3 | 1 |
| Issuance of ordinary shares upon net settlement of warrants | 33 | 2 |

## Exchangeable Notes

The table below presents the changes in the Exchangeable Notes:

| | 2024 (in millions) | 2023 (in millions) |
|---|---|---|
| At January 1 | 1,203 | 1,128 |
| Changes in fair value recognized in interim condensed consolidated statement of operations | 145 | 51 |
| Changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive (loss)/income | 5 | 14 |
| Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates | 13 | 16 |
| **At September 30** | **1,340** | **1,209** |

### At January 1

- Changes in fair value recognized in interim condensed consolidated statement of operations
- Changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive (loss)/income
- Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates

### At September 30

The change in estimated fair value is recognized within finance (costs)/income - net in the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations, excluding changes in fair value due to changes in the Group’s own credit risk, which are recognized in other comprehensive (loss)/income and will not be reclassified to the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations.

The fair value of the Exchangeable Notes was estimated using a combination of a binomial option pricing model and prices observed for the Exchangeable Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the reporting period. A weight of 50% was applied to the binomial option pricing model and a weight of 50% was applied to the price of the Exchangeable Notes in the over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the period. The key assumptions used in the binomial option pricing model for the Exchangeable Notes were as follows:

| Risk free rate (%) | Discount rate (%) | Volatility (%) | Share price (USS) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.83% | 5.85 % | 40 % | 368.53 |

A decrease or increase of 10 percentage points in volatility would have resulted in a fair value of the Exchangeable Notes ranging from £1,318 million to £1,363 million at September 30, 2024. A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price would have resulted in a fair value of the Exchangeable Notes ranging from £1,323 million to £1,361 million at September 30, 2024. A decrease or increase of 100 basis points in credit spread would have resulted in a fair value of the Exchangeable Notes ranging from £1,347 million to £1,333 million at September 30, 2024.

## Segment Information

The Group has two reportable segments: Premium and Ad-Supported. Revenue for the Premium segment is generated primarily through subscription fees. Revenue for the Ad-Supported segment is primarily generated through the sale of advertising across the Group's music and podcast content. Royalty costs are primarily recorded in each segment based on specific rates for each segment agreed to with rights holders. All Podcast content costs are recorded in the Ad-Supported segment. The costs of providing audiobook content as part of the Premium subscription are recorded in the Premium segment. The remaining costs that are not specifically associated with either of the segments are allocated based on user activity or the revenue recognized in each segment. No operating segments have been aggregated to form the reportable segments.

## 21. Commitments and contingencies

### Commitments

The Group is subject to the following minimum guarantees relating to the content on its Service, the majority of which relate to minimum royalty payments associated with its license agreements for the use of licensed content:

|  | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
|---|---|---|
| **Not later than one year** | 1,331 | 1,055 |
| **Later than one year but not more than five years** | 386 | 3,610 |

In addition, the Group is subject to various non-cancelable purchase obligations and service agreements with minimum spend commitments, including a service agreement with Google for the use of Google Cloud Platform and certain podcast and marketing commitments:

|  | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
|---|---|---|
| **Not later than one year** | 619 | 453 |
| **Later than one year but not more than five years** | 952 | 1,369 |
| **More than five years** | 68 | 83 |

### Contingencies

Various legal actions, proceedings, and claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted against the Group. These may include, but are not limited to, matters relating to intellectual property, data protection, consumer protection, employment, and contractual rights. As a general matter, the music and other content made available on the Group's Service are licensed to the Group by various third parties. Many of these licenses allow rights holders or other authorized parties to audit the Group's royalty payments, and any such audit could result in disputes over whether the Group has paid the proper royalties. If such a dispute were to occur, the Group could be required to pay additional royalties, and the amounts involved could be material. The Group expenses legal fees as incurred. The Group records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Group's operations or its financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

On May 16, 2024, the Mechanical Licensing Collective ("MLC") filed a lawsuit against Spotify USA Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that beginning with its March 2024 report, Spotify USA Inc. improperly reported and underpaid royalties for its Premium Service as a bundle that includes a specified monthly allocation of audiobook access. If the MLC were entirely successful in this case, the additional royalties that would be due in relation to the period March 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024 would be approximately €94 million, plus potentially penalties and interest, which we cannot reasonably estimate. We intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit.

## Key Performance Indicators

We use certain key performance indicators to monitor and manage our business. We use these indicators to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. We believe these indicators provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner we do.

### MAUs

We track MAUs as an indicator of the size of the audience engaged with our Service. We define MAUs as the total count of Ad-Supported Users and Premium Subscribers that have consumed content for greater than zero milliseconds in the last thirty days from the period-end indicated. Reported MAUs may overstate the number of unique individuals who actively use our Service within a thirty-day period as individuals may register for, and use, multiple accounts. Additionally, although we strive to detect and minimize non-bona fide accounts that may typically be created in an attempt to artificially stream content, they may contribute, from time to time, to an overstatement in our reported MAUs. Our MAUs in the tables below are inclusive of Ad-Supported Users who may have employed methods to limit or otherwise avoid being served advertisements.

The table below sets forth our MAUs as of September 30, 2024 and 2023.

| As of September 30 | 2024 | 2023 | Change |
| -------------------- | ---- | ---- | ------ |
| MAUs (in millions, except percentages) | 640 | 574 | 66 | 11% |

MAUs were 640 million as of September 30, 2024 and 574 million as of September 30, 2023, which represented an increase of 11%. MAUs benefited from our continued investment in driving the growth of our Service through successful consumer marketing campaigns, enhanced content offerings, and product enhancements, resulting in continued user engagement and customer satisfaction.

### Premium Subscribers

We define Premium Subscribers as users that have completed registration with Spotify and have activated a payment method for Premium Service and other subscription offerings (collectively, "Subscription Offerings"). Our Premium Subscribers include all registered accounts in our Family Plan and Duo Plan. Our Family Plan consists of one primary subscriber and up to five additional sub-accounts, allowing up to six Premium Subscribers per Family Plan Subscription. Our Duo Plan consists of one primary subscriber and up to one additional sub-account, allowing up to two Premium Subscribers per Duo Plan Subscription. Premium Subscribers include subscribers in a grace period of up to 30 days after failing to pay their subscription fee.

The table below sets forth our Premium Subscribers as of September 30, 2024 and 2023.

| As of September 30 | 2024 | 2023 | Change |
| -------------------- | ---- | ---- | ------ |
| Premium Subscribers (in millions, except percentages) | 252 | 226 | 26 | 12% |

Premium Subscribers were 252 million as of September 30, 2024 and 226 million as of September 30, 2023, which represented an increase of 12%. Our Family Plan and Duo Plan were meaningful contributors of total gross additions in Premium Subscribers, while our free trial offers and global campaigns also accounted for a significant portion of gross additions in Premium Subscribers.

### Ad-Supported MAUs

We define Ad-Supported MAUs as the total count of Ad-Supported Users that have consumed content for greater than zero milliseconds in the last thirty days from the period-end indicated.

# Page 33

## Ad-Supported MAUs

The table below sets forth our Ad-Supported MAUs as of September 30, 2024 and 2023.

| As of September 30 | 2024 | 2023 | Change |
|--------------------|------|------|--------|
| (in millions, except percentages) | 402   | 361  | 41     |
| | | | 11%  |

Ad-Supported MAUs were 402 million as of September 30, 2024 and 361 million as of September 30, 2023, which represented an increase of 11%. Ad-Supported MAUs benefited from our continued investment in driving the growth of our Ad-Supported Service through successful consumer marketing campaigns, enhanced content offerings, and product enhancements, resulting in continued Ad-Supported User engagement and customer satisfaction.

## Premium ARPU

Premium average revenue per user ("ARPU") is a monthly measure defined as Premium subscription revenue recognized in the quarter indicated divided by the average daily Premium Subscribers in such quarter, which is then divided by three months. Fiscal year-to-date figures are calculated by averaging Premium ARPU for the quarters in such period.

The table below sets forth our average Premium ARPU for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

| | Three months ended September 30, 2024 | Nine months ended September 30, 2024 |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Premium ARPU    | € 4.71         | € 4.63       |
|                 | € 4.34         | € 4.31       |
| Change          | € 0.37         | € 0.32       |
|                 | 9 %            | 7 %          |

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Premium ARPU was €4.71 and €4.34, respectively, which represented an increase of 9%. This increase of €0.37 is primarily attributable to price increases, resulting in a €0.60 increase in Premium ARPU. This increase was partially offset by changes in product and market mix, decreasing ARPU by €0.24, and unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates, decreasing Premium ARPU by €0.11.

The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Premium ARPU was €4.63 and €4.31, respectively, which represented an increase of 7%. The increase of €0.32 is primarily attributable to price increases, resulting in a €0.52 increase in Premium ARPU. This increase was partially offset by changes in product and market mix, decreasing ARPU by €0.12, and unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates, decreasing Premium ARPU by €0.08.

## How We Generate Revenue

We operate and manage our business in two reportable segments - Premium and Ad-Supported. We identify our reportable segments based on the organizational units used by the chief operating decision maker to monitor performance and make operating decisions.

### Premium

We generate revenue for our Premium segment through the sale of subscriptions to the Subscription Offerings. The Subscription Offerings are primarily sold directly to end users. The Premium Service is also sold through partners who are generally telecommunications companies that bundle the subscription with their own services or collect payment for the stand-alone subscriptions from their end users. Premium partner subscription revenue is based on a per-subscriber rate in a negotiated partner agreement. We also bundle the Premium Service with other services and products.

### Ad-Supported

We generate revenue for our Ad-Supported segment primarily from the sale of display, audio, and video advertising delivered through advertising impressions across our music and podcast content. We generally enter into arrangements with advertising agencies that purchase advertising on behalf of their clients and we also enter into arrangements directly with some large advertisers. These advertising arrangements are typically sold on a cost-per-thousand impressions ("CPM") basis and are evidenced by an insertion order that specifies the terms of the arrangement such as the type of advertising product, pricing, insertion dates, and number of impressions or downloads in a stated period. Additionally, we generate revenue through arrangements with certain advertising automated exchanges, an internal self-serve platform, and advertising marketplace programs to distribute advertising inventory for purchase on a CPM basis.

## Components of our Operating Results

### Cost of revenue
Cost of revenue consists predominantly of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming. We incur royalty costs, which we pay to certain record labels, music publishers, and other rights holders, for the right to stream content to our users. Music royalties are typically calculated monthly based on a combination of different variables. Generally, Subscription Offering music royalties are based on the greater of a percentage of revenue and a per user amount. Music royalties for the Ad-Supported Service are typically a percentage of relevant revenue, although certain agreements are based on the greater of a percentage of relevant revenue and an amount for each time a track is streamed. We have negotiated lower per user amounts for our lower priced subscription plans such as our Family Plan, Duo Plan, and Student Plan. In our agreements with certain record labels, the percentage of revenue used in the calculation of royalties is generally dependent upon certain targets being met. The targets can include such measures as the number of applicable Premium Subscribers, the ratio of Ad-Supported Users to applicable Premium Subscribers, and/or the rates of applicable Premium Subscriber churn. In addition, royalty rates vary by country. Some of our royalty agreements require that royalty costs be paid in advance or are subject to minimum guaranteed amounts. For the majority of royalty agreements, incremental costs incurred due to unrecouped advances and minimum guarantees have not been significant to date. We also have certain so-called most favored nation royalty agreements, which require us to record additional costs if certain material contract terms are not as favorable as the terms we have agreed to with similar licensors. Cost of revenue also reflects discounts provided by certain rights holders in return for promotional activities in connection with marketplace programs. Additionally, it includes the costs of discounted trials. Royalties payable in relation to book licenses are generally consumption based.

Cost of revenue also includes the cost of podcast content assets (both produced and licensed). Amortization of podcast content assets is recorded over the shorter of the estimated useful economic life or the license period (if relevant) and begins at the release of each episode. We make payments to podcast publishers, whose content we monetize through advertising sales in the Spotify Audience Network, which are also included in cost of revenue.

Cost of revenue also includes credit card and payment processing fees for subscription revenue, advertising serving, advertising measurement, customer service, certain employee compensation and benefits, cloud computing, streaming, facility, and equipment costs.

### Research and Development
We invest heavily in research and development in order to drive user engagement and customer satisfaction on our platform, which we believe helps drive organic growth in MAUs, which, in turn, drives additional growth in, and better retention of, Premium Subscribers, as well as increased advertising opportunities to our users. We aim to design products and features that create and enhance user experiences, and new technologies are at the core of many of these opportunities. Expenses primarily comprise costs incurred for the development of products related to our platform and service, as well as new and existing advertising products and improvements to our mobile application and desktop application and streaming services. The costs incurred include related facility costs, consulting costs, and employee compensation and benefits costs. We expect engineers to represent a significant portion of our employees over the foreseeable future.

Many of our new products and improvements to our platform require large investments and involve substantial time and risks to develop and launch. Some of these products may not be well received or may take a long time for users to adopt. As a result, the benefits of our research and development investments are difficult to forecast.

### Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses primarily comprise employee compensation and benefits, public relations, branding, consulting expenses, customer acquisition costs, advertising, marketing events and trade shows, amortization of trade name intangible assets, the cost of working with content creators and rights holders to promote the availability of new releases on our platform, and the costs of providing free trials. Expenses included in the cost of providing free trials are derived primarily from per user royalty fees determined in accordance with the rights holder agreements.

### General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses primarily comprise employee compensation and benefits for functions such as finance, accounting, analytics, legal, human resources, consulting fees, and other costs including facility and equipment costs, directors' and officers' liability insurance, and director fees.

#### Premium revenue

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Premium revenue comprised 88% and 87% of our total revenue, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, Premium revenue increased €606 million, or 21%. The increase was due primarily to an increase in the number of Premium Subscribers and an increase in Premium ARPU.

For both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Premium revenue comprised 88% of our total revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Premium revenue increased €1,718 million, or 20%. The increase was due primarily to an increase in the number of Premium Subscribers and an increase in Premium ARPU.

#### Ad-Supported revenue

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Ad-Supported revenue comprised 12% and 13% of our total revenue, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, Ad-Supported revenue increased €25 million, or 6%. This increase was due primarily to growth in impressions sold, which increased revenue from programmatic channels and our self-serve platform by €15 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

For both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Ad-Supported revenue comprised 12% of our total revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Ad-Supported revenue increased €137 million, or 12%. The increase was due primarily to growth in music impressions sold, which increased revenue in our direct and programmatic channels as well as our self-serve platform by €91 million. The remaining increase was due primarily to growth in podcast impressions sold and marketplace programs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

#### Foreign exchange impact on total revenue

The general movement of the Euro relative to certain foreign currencies, as well as movement in the Argentine Peso, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, had an unfavorable net impact on our revenue. We estimate that total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have been approximately €91 million and €185 million higher, respectively, if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with foreign exchange rates for the comparable period in 2023.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, Ad-Supported cost of revenue remained flat at €410 million, and Ad-Supported cost of revenue as a percentage of Ad-Supported revenue decreased from 92% to 87%. The three months ended September 30, 2024 included a €9 million decrease in cost of revenue primarily related to a reduction in podcast production and personnel costs. These cost reductions were partially offset by higher royalty costs of €5 million due to growth in both advertising revenue and the volume of streams, offset by growth in certain marketplace programs during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Ad-Supported cost of revenue decreased €7 million, or 1%, and Ad-Supported cost of revenue as a percentage of Ad-Supported revenue decreased from 100% to 89%. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 included €46 million of strategic realignment and reorganization costs relating to the write-off of content assets, contract termination and other related costs, and employee severance for which there were no material comparable costs from a decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also benefited from changes of €22 million primarily related to a reduction in podcast production and personnel costs. These cost reductions were partially offset by an increase in royalty costs of €54 million due to growth in both advertising revenue and the volume of streams, partially offset by benefits from certain marketplace programs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

### Foreign exchange impact on total cost of revenue
The general movement of the Euro relative to certain foreign currencies, as well as movement in the Argentine Peso, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, had a favorable net impact on our cost of revenue. We estimate that total cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have been approximately €69 million and €140 million higher, respectively, if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with foreign exchange rates for the comparable period in 2023.

## Premium gross profit and gross margin

### Three months ended September 30, 2024
Premium gross profit increased by €330 million, and Premium gross margin increased from 29% to 34%. Benefits are primarily due to revenue growth outpacing music royalty costs and a reduction in streaming delivery costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

### Nine months ended September 30, 2024
Premium gross profit increased by €795 million, and Premium gross margin rose from 29% to 32%. This increase was largely due to benefits from certain marketplace programs and additional revenue outpacing licensing costs.

## Ad-Supported gross profit/(loss) and gross margin

### Three months ended September 30, 2024
Ad-Supported gross profit increased by €25 million, and gross margin increased from 8% to 13%. The increase was supported by a reduction in costs related to podcast production and streaming services.

### Nine months ended September 30, 2024
Ad-Supported gross profit increased by €144 million, and the gross margin rose from 11%. The significant margin improvement was primarily due to a strategic realignment and cost reductions in content rights and personnel.

Share-based compensation deductions recognized in equity. In addition, €27 million of deferred tax expense was primarily related to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, income tax expense was €8 million. 

### For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024

Income tax expense was €71 million. €150 million of current income tax expense was primarily related to profitability within the Group and did not reflect a €114 million excess tax benefit of share-based compensation deductions recognized in equity. This was partially offset by the recognition of deferred tax assets resulting in a deferred tax benefit of €119 million. In addition, €27 million of deferred tax expense was primarily related to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, income tax expense was €88 million.

## Non-IFRS Financial Measure

We have reported our interim financial results in accordance with IAS 34 as issued by the IASB. In addition, we have discussed our results using the non-IFRS measure of Free Cash Flow.

### Free Cash Flow

We define “Free Cash Flow” as net cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures and change in restricted cash. We believe Free Cash Flow is a useful supplemental financial measure for us and investors in assessing our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments and to service our debt. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of our liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities.

Free Cash Flow is a non-IFRS measure and is not a substitute for IFRS measures in assessing our overall financial performance. 

### Reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash flows from operating activities

- **Nine months ended September 30, 2024**
  - Net cash flows from operating activities: €1,418 million
  - Capital expenditures: (€11 million)
  - Change in restricted cash: €1 million
  - **Free Cash Flow: €1,408 million**

- **Nine months ended September 30, 2023**
  - Net cash flows from operating activities: €283 million
  - Capital expenditures: (€5 million)
  - Change in restricted cash: €4 million
  - **Free Cash Flow: €282 million**

---

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and cash generated from operating activities. Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased by €1,866 million from €4,214 million as of December 31, 2023, to €6,080 million as of September 30, 2024.

We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and the cash flow we generate from our operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and other liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital requirements may be materially different than those currently planned in our budgeting and forecasting activities and depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products, the acquisition of other companies, competitive factors, and global.

## Table of Contents

### Economic Conditions
To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our shareholders, while the incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations. Such debt instruments also could introduce covenants that might restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that we could obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.

### Technology
We continue to evaluate our real estate footprint to optimize our global office space while making necessary investments in offices and information technology infrastructure to grow our business. We find these investments using current cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow from operations. Given the impact of our Work From Anywhere program and in conjunction with a strategic review of our real estate footprint and space utilization trends, our focus has shifted more towards optimizing our current portfolio and reviewing our real estate needs around the world as opposed to significant expansions of our presence in current markets. This has resulted in a reduction of our real estate footprint as we have decided to sublease certain leased office space.

### Share Repurchase Program
On August 20, 2021, the Company announced that the board of directors had approved a program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s ordinary shares. Repurchases of up to 10,000,000 of the Company's ordinary shares were authorized at the Company's general meeting of shareholders on April 21, 2021. The share repurchase program will expire on April 21, 2026. Since the commencement of this repurchase program and through September 30, 2024, 469,274 ordinary shares were repurchased for €999 million under this program.

The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and growth investment opportunities. The repurchase program is executed consistent with the Company’s capital allocation strategy of prioritizing investment to repurchase business over the long term. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of ordinary shares, and the actual proceeds may vary based on the discretion and initiative at any time at the Company’s discretion. The Company uses current cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow it generates from operations to fund the share repurchase program.

### Exchangeable Notes
On March 2, 2021, Spotify USA Inc. issued US$1,500 million in aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes. Net proceeds from the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes were €1,223 million after deducting the transaction costs.

### Cash Flow

#### Net cash flows from operating activities
#### Net cash flows used in investing activities
#### Net cash flows from financing activities
#### Free Cash Flow

### Operating Activities
Net cash flows from operating activities increased by €1,135 million to €1,418 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation, amortization, impairment charges on real estate assets, write-off of content assets, and share-based compensation expense, resulting in an increase in cash flows from operating activities of €1,050 million in aggregate. There was also an increase in interest received on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of €78 million.

# Page 42

## Investing activities

Net cash flows used in investing activities increased by €76 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase in net cash outflows from purchases and sales and maturities of short-term investments of €75 million. Net cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, also included €18 million of dividends received, whereas no such activity occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

## Financing activities

Net cash flows from financing activities increased by €445 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of €492 million, partially offset by an increase in payments for employee taxes withheld from restricted stock unit releases of €43 million.

## Free Cash Flow

Free Cash Flow increased by €1,126 million to €1,408 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to an increase in net cash flows from operating activities of €1,135 million.

## Restrictions on subsidiaries to transfer funds

The payment of dividends and the making, or repayment, of loans and advances to the Company by the Company's direct subsidiaries and by its indirect subsidiaries to their respective parent entities are subject to various restrictions. Future indebtedness of these subsidiaries may prohibit the payment of dividends or the making, or repayment, of loans or advances to the Company. In addition, the ability of any of the Company's direct or indirect subsidiaries to make certain distributions may be limited by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the subsidiaries are organized or located. Since the Company is expected to rely primarily on dividends from its direct and indirect subsidiaries to fund its financial and other obligations, restrictions on its ability to receive such funds may adversely impact the Company's ability to fund its financial and other obligations.

## Indebtedness

As of September 30, 2024, our outstanding indebtedness, other than lease liabilities, consisted primarily of the Exchangeable Notes that mature on March 15, 2026, and bear no interest. We may, from time to time, seek to incur additional indebtedness. Such indebtedness, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors.

## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of September 30, 2024, we do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as

## Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our activities expose us to a variety of market risks. Our primary market risk exposures relate to currency, interest rate, share price, and investment risks. To manage these risks and our exposure to the unpredictability of financial markets, we seek to minimize potential adverse effects on our financial performance and capital.

### Volatile market conditions caused by significant events with macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to, inflation, changes in interest rates, geopolitical conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, and related market uncertainty, may result in significant changes to foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and share prices, both on our own and those of third parties we use to value certain of our long term investments.

## Currency Risk

Currency risk manifests itself in transaction exposure, which relates to business transactions denominated in foreign currency required by operations (purchasing and selling) and/or financing (interest and amortization). The volatility in foreign exchange rates, in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the Euro, may negatively affect our revenue. Our general policy is to hedge transaction exposure on a case-by-case basis. Translation exposure relates to net investments in foreign operations. We do not conduct translation risk hedging.

### Transaction exposure sensitivity

In most cases, our customers are billed in their respective local currency. Major payments, such as salaries, consultancy fees, and rental fees are settled in local currencies. Royalty payments are primarily settled in Euros and U.S. dollars. Hence, the operational need to not purchase foreign currency is due primarily to a deficit from such settlements.

The table below shows the immediate impact on Income/(loss) before tax of a 10% strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the Euro in the closing exchange rate of significant currencies to which we have transaction exposure, at September 30, 2024. The sensitivity associated with a 10% weakening of a particular currency would be equal and opposite. This assumes that each currency moves in isolation.

| Currency               | Impact on Income/(loss) before tax (in millions) |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Swedish krona (SEK)   | (11)                                       |
| British pound (GBP)   |                                             |
| U.S. dollar (USD)     | 71                                          |

# Page 44

## Translation Exposure Sensitivity

The impact on our equity would be approximately €170 million if the Euro weakened by 10% against all translation exposure currencies, based on the exposure at September 30, 2024.

## Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will have a negative impact on earnings and cash flow. Our exposure to interest rate risk is related to our interest-bearing assets, including our cash and cash equivalents and our short-term debt securities. Fluctuations in interest rates impact the yield of the investment. The sensitivity analysis considered the historical volatility of short-term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease or increase in interest rates would have resulted in a change in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of €14 million and €37 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

## Share Price Risk

Share price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in the fair value of the company's ordinary share price. Our exposure to this risk relates primarily to the Exchangeable Notes and accrual for social costs on outstanding share-based compensation awards.

A 10% decrease or increase in the Company’s ordinary share price would have resulted in a fair value of the Exchangeable Notes ranging from €1,323 million to €1,361 million at September 30, 2024.

A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price would have resulted in a decrease or increase in the accrual for social costs on outstanding share-based compensation awards of €32 million at September 30, 2024.

## Investment Risk

We are exposed to investment risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our long-term investments, due primarily to volatility in the share price used to measure the investment and exchange rates. The majority of our long-term investments relate to TME. A 10% decrease or increase in TME's share price would have resulted in a fair value of the Group's long-term investment in TME ranging from €1,377 million to €1,684 million at September 30, 2024.

## Inflation Risk

Inflationary factors, such as increases in costs, may adversely affect our results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases for our Subscription Offerings or sale of advertisements. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We prepare our interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. Preparing these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.

We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, share-based compensation, content provisions, Exchangeable Notes, warranties, income taxes, business combinations, lease agreements, impairment of real estate assets, and goodwill impairment have the greatest potential impact on our interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.

There have been no material changes or additions to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our Annual Report on Form 20-F.

## Recent Accounting Pronouncements

On January 1, 2024, the Group adopted the IASB issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments are applied on a retrospective basis and require the Group to reclassify the Exchangeable Notes as a current liability if the exchange conditions are not met, even if no note holder actually requires us to exchange their notes. Adoption of this amendment did not result in the reclassification of the Exchangeable Notes as a current liability at any reporting date, from the inception of the Exchangeable Notes to September 30, 2024, as the exchange conditions had not been met.

## PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

### Item 1. Legal Proceeding

We are, from time to time, subject to various claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings. Some of these claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings involve highly complex issues, and often these issues are subject to substantial uncertainties. Accordingly, our potential liability with respect to a large portion of such claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings cannot be estimated with certainty. Management, with the assistance of legal counsel, periodically reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses potential financial exposure. We recognize provisions for claims or pending litigation when it determines that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertain nature of litigation, the ultimate outcome or actual cost of settlement may materially vary from estimates. If management's estimates prove incorrect, current reserves could be inadequate and we could incur a charge to earnings which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.

### Item 1A. Risk Factors

There have been no material changes from the risk factors and information disclosed in Part I, Item 3.D. “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 20-F.
