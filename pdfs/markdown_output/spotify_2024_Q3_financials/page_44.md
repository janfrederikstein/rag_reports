## Translation Exposure Sensitivity

The impact on our equity would be approximately €170 million if the Euro weakened by 10% against all translation exposure currencies, based on the exposure at September 30, 2024. 

## Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will have a negative impact on earnings and cash flow. Our exposure to interest rate risk is related to our interest-bearing assets, including our cash and cash equivalents and our short term debt securities. Fluctuations in interest rates impact the yield of the investment. The sensitivity analysis considered the historical volatility of short term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease or increase in interest rates would have resulted in a change in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of €14 million and €37 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

## Share Price risk

Share price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in the fair value of the Company's ordinary share price. Our exposure to this risk relates primarily to the Exchangeable Notes and accrual for social costs on outstanding share-based compensation awards.

A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price would have resulted in a fair value of the Exchangeable Notes ranging from €1,323 million to €1,361 million at September 30, 2024.

A 10% decrease or increase in the Company's ordinary share price would have resulted in a decrease or increase in the accrual for social costs on outstanding share-based compensation awards of €32 million at September 30, 2024.

## Investment risk

We are exposed to investment risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our long term investments, due primarily to volatility in the share price used to measure the investment and exchange rates. The majority of our long term investments relate to TIME. A 10% decrease or increase in TIME's share price would have resulted in a fair value of the Group's long term investment in TIME ranging from €1,737 million to €1,684 million at September 30, 2024.

## Inflation risk

Inflationary factors, such as increases in costs, may adversely affect our results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases for our Subscription Offerings or sale of advertisements. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

## Critical accounting policies and estimates

We prepare our interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. Preparing these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.

We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, share-based compensation, content, provisions, Exchangeable Notes, warrants, income taxes, business combinations, lease agreements, impairment of real estate assets, and goodwill impairment have the greatest potential impact on our interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.

There have been no material changes or additions to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our Annual Report on Form 20-F.

## Recent accounting pronouncements

On January 1, 2024, the Group adopted the IASB issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments are applied on a retrospective basis and require the Group to reclassify the Exchangeable Notes (as defined below) as a current liability if the exchange conditions are met, even if no note holder actually requires us to exchange their notes. Adoption of this amendment did not result in the reclassification of the Exchangeable Notes as a current liability at any reporting date, from the inception of the Exchangeable Notes to September 30, 2024, as the exchange conditions had not been met.
