## Investing activities

Net cash flows used in investing activities increased by €76 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase in net cash outflows from purchases and sales and maturities of short term investments of €75 million. Net cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included €18 million of dividends received whereas no such activity occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

## Financing activities

Net cash flows from financing activities increased by €445 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of €492 million, partially offset by an increase in payments for employee taxes withheld from restricted stock unit releases of €43 million.

## Free Cash Flow

Free Cash Flow increased by €1,126 million to €1,408 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to an increase in net cash flows from operating activities of €1,135 million, as described above.

## Restrictions on subsidiaries to transfer funds

The payment of dividends and the making, or repayment, of loans and advances to the Company by the Company's direct subsidiaries and by its indirect subsidiaries to their respective parent entities are subject to various restrictions. Future indebtedness of these subsidiaries may prohibit the payment of dividends or the making, or repayment, of loans or advances to the Company. In addition, the ability of any of the Company's direct or indirect subsidiaries to make certain distributions may be limited by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the subsidiaryaries are organized or located. Since the Company is expected to rely primarily on dividends from its direct and indirect subsidiaries to fund its financial and other obligations, restrictions on its ability to receive such funds may adversely impact the Company's ability to fund its financial and other obligations.

## Indebtedness

As of September 30, 2024, our outstanding indebtedness, other than lease liabilities, consisted primarily of the Exchangeable Notes that mature on March 15, 2026 and bear no interest. See Note 15 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our Exchangeable Notes. We may, from time to time, seek to incur additional indebtedness. Such indebtedness, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors.
