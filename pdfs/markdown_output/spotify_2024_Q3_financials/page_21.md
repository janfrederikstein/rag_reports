## 15. Exchangeable Notes

On March 2, 2021, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Spotify USA Inc. (the “Issuer”), issued US$1,500 million aggregate principal amount of 0% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Exchangeable Notes”), which included the initial purchasers’ exercise in full of their option to purchase an additional US$200 million principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes. The Exchangeable Notes will mature on March 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or exchanged. The Exchangeable Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis by the Company. The transaction costs were immediately expensed and included in finance costs in the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021.

The Exchangeable Notes are the Issuer’s senior unsecured obligations and are equally in right of payment with the Issuer's future senior, unsecured indebtedness, senior in right of payment to the Issuer’s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Exchangeable Notes and effectively subordinated to the Issuer’s future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness. The Exchangeable Notes will be structurally subordinated to all future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent the Issuer is not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of the Issuer’s subsidiaries.

The noteholders may exchange their Exchangeable Notes at their option under certain circumstances that exist, at the Issuer’s election, of ordinary course of the Company, or a combination of cash and ordinary shares, but only into consideration certain concessions as set forth in the Indenture governing the Exchangeable Notes (the “Indenture”). The circumstances required to allow the noteholders to exchange their Exchangeable Notes were not met during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The Exchangeable Notes were not redeemable prior to March 20, 2024, except in the event of certain tax law changes as set forth in the Indenture. As of March 20, 2024, the Exchangeable Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Issuer’s option at any time, and from time to time, and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any, but only if the last reported sale price per ordinary share exceeds 130% of the exchange price on:

1. each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Issuer sends the related redemption notice; and
2. the trading day immediately before the date the Issuer sends such notice.

In addition, the Issuer will have the right to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Exchangeable Notes if certain changes in tax law as set forth in the Indenture occur. In addition, calling any Exchangeable Note for redemption will constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to that Exchangeable Note, in which case the exchange rate applicable to the exchange of that Exchangeable Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is exchanged after it is called for redemption.

Upon the occurrence of a “fundamental change” as set forth in the Indenture, noteholders may require the Issuer to repurchase their Exchangeable Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any, but to excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date as set forth in the Indenture.

The Group accounted for the Exchangeable Notes at fair value through profit and loss using the fair value option in accordance with IFRS 9, Financial Instruments. The fair value of the Exchangeable Notes as of September 30, 2024 was US$288.34. The weighted-average fair value of options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was US$117.87 per option.
