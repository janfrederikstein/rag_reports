### Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our activities expose us to a variety of market risks. Our primary market risk exposures relate to currency, interest rate, share price, and investment risks. To manage these risks and our exposure to the unpredictability of financial markets, we seek to minimize potential adverse effects on our financial performance and capital.

Volatile market conditions caused by significant events with macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to, inflation, changes in interest rates, geopolitical conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, and related market uncertainty, may result in significant changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and share prices, both our own and those of third parties we use to value certain of our long term investments. Refer to Part I, Item 3.D. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for further discussion on the impact of worldwide economic conditions on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

#### Currency Risk

Currency risk manifests itself in transaction exposure, which relates to business transactions denominated in foreign currency required by operations (purchasing and selling) and/or financing (interest and amortization). The volatility in foreign exchange rates, in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the Euro, may negatively affect our revenue. Our general policy is to hedge transaction exposure on a case-by-case basis. Translation exposure relates to net investments in foreign operations. We do not conduct translation risk hedging.

#### Transaction Exposure Sensitivity

In most cases, our customers are billed in their respective local currency. Major payments, such as salaries, consultancy fees, and rental fees are settled in local currencies. Royalty payments are primarily settled in Euros and U.S. dollars. Hence, the operational need to not purchase foreign currency is due primarily to a deficit from such settlements.

The table below shows the immediate impact on Income/(loss) before tax of a 10% strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the Euro in the closing exchange rate of significant currencies to which we have transaction exposure, at September 30, 2024. The sensitivity associated with a 10% weakening of a particular currency would be equal and opposite. This assumes that each currency moves in isolation.
