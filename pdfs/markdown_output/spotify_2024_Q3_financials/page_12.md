### Earnings Analysis

- For the three months ending September 30, 2024, the **Group** recorded a tax expense of €88 million, where €12 million of current income tax expense was attributed to subsidiaries within a taxable profit within the Group. However, a net operating loss carryforward reduced recordable profits by assets primarily related to the music entertainment group due to a decrease in unrealized gain on long-term investment.

- Notably, for the nine months ending September 30, 2024, the total income tax expense was dramatically higher at €171 million, yet €150 million of current income tax expense was incurred, partly offset by a €114 million deferred tax benefit from share-based compensation and €27 million from deferred tax expense related to recognition of net deferred tax assets.

### Comprehensive Income

- Income and losses that are not reflected in the net income were reported separately, under other comprehensive (loss)/income. Deferred tax assets and bases compensation deductions in equity notably influenced these figures.

### Regulatory Challenges and Financial Projections

- The **Group** is subject to the OECD's Pillar 2 Model Rules ("P2 Rules"), which have been substantively enacted but have not materially affected the current financial statements. The potential tax exposure regarding these rules is continually evaluated for material impact, particularly focusing on jurisdictions such as Luxembourg and Sweden.

- The likelihood of audit outcomes in different jurisdictions and their impact on tax positions is constantly monitored, reflecting uncertainty in regulatory landscapes and possible obligations due in near future.

### Asset Evaluation

- For the timeframe ending December 31, 2023, deferred tax assets valued at €721 million and €762 million show significant potential due to the recognition of deducible temporary differences and net operating loss carry-forwards, mainly in Sweden. This reflects a robust assessment of future taxable profits and management's strategic tax position planning.

### Performance Metrics

- **Net Deferred Tax Assets**: Notable increases in tax assets were recorded between September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, primarily due to reevaluation of the probability of utilizing deferred tax assets, representing a comprehensive analysis of fiscal potential and existing tax strategies.

### Earnings per Share (EPS) Computation
