## Key Performance Indicators

We use certain key performance indicators to monitor and manage our business. We use these indicators to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. We believe these indicators provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner we do.

### MAUs

We track MAUs as an indicator of the size of the audience engaged with our Service. We define MAUs as the total count of Ad-Supported Users and Premium Subscribers that have consumed content for greater than zero milliseconds in the last thirty days from the period-end indicated. Reported MAUs may overstate the number of unique individuals who actively use our Service within a thirty-day period as individuals may register for, and use, multiple accounts. Additionally, although we strive to detect and minimize non-bona fide accounts that may typically be created in an attempt to artificially stream content, they may contribute, from time to time, to an overstatement in our reported MAUs. Our MAUs in the tables below are inclusive of Ad-Supported Users who may have employed methods to limit or otherwise avoid being served advertisements. For additional information, refer to the risk factors discussed under Part I, Item 3.D. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 20-F, and in our other filings with the SEC.

The table below sets forth our MAUs as of September 30, 2024 and 2023.

| As of September 30 | 2024 | 2023 | Change |
| -------------------- | ---- | ---- | ------ |
| MAUs (in millions, except percentages) | 640 | 574 | 66 | 11% |

MAUs were 640 million as of September 30, 2024 and 574 million as of September 30, 2023, which represented an increase of 11%. MAUs benefited from our continued investment in driving the growth of our Service through successful consumer marketing campaigns, enhanced content offerings, and product enhancements, resulting in continued user engagement and customer satisfaction.

### Premium Subscribers

We define Premium Subscribers as users that have completed registration with Spotify and have activated a payment method for Premium Service and other subscription offerings (collectively, "Subscription Offerings"). Our Premium Subscribers include all registered accounts in our Family Plan and Duo Plan. Our Family Plan consists of one primary subscriber and up to five additional sub-accounts, allowing up to six Premium Subscribers per Family Plan Subscription. Our Duo Plan consists of one primary subscriber and up to one additional sub-account, allowing up to two Premium Subscribers per Duo Plan Subscription. Premium Subscribers include subscribers in a grace period of up to 30 days after failing to pay their subscription fee.

The table below sets forth our Premium Subscribers as of September 30, 2024 and 2023.

| As of September 30 | 2024 | 2023 | Change |
| -------------------- | ---- | ---- | ------ |
| Premium Subscribers (in millions, except percentages) | 252 | 226 | 26 | 12% |

Premium Subscribers were 252 million as of September 30, 2024 and 226 million as of September 30, 2023, which represented an increase of 12%. Our Family Plan and Duo Plan were meaningful contributors of total gross additions in Premium Subscribers, while our free trial offers and global campaigns also accounted for a significant portion of gross additions in Premium Subscribers.

### Ad-Supported MAUs
