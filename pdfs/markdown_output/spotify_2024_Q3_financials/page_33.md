## Premium ARPU

Premium average revenue per user ("ARPU") is a monthly measure defined as Premium subscription revenue recognized in the quarter indicated divided by the average daily Premium Subscribers in such quarter, which is then divided by three months. Fiscal year-to-date figures are calculated by averaging Premium ARPU for the quarters in such period.

The table below sets forth our average Premium ARPU for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

| | Three months ended September 30, 2024 | Nine months ended September 30, 2024 |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Premium ARPU    | € 4.71         | € 4.63       |
|                 | € 4.34         | € 4.31       |
| Change          | € 0.37         | € 0.32       |
|                 | 9 %            | 7 %          |

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Premium ARPU was €4.71 and €4.34, respectively, which represented an increase of 9%. This increase of €0.37 is primarily attributable to price increases, resulting in a €0.60 increase in Premium ARPU. This increase was partially offset by changes in product and market mix, decreasing ARPU by €0.24, and unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates, decreasing Premium ARPU by €0.11.

The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Premium ARPU was €4.63 and €4.31, respectively, which represented an increase of 7%. The increase of €0.32 is primarily attributable to price increases, resulting in a €0.52 increase in Premium ARPU. This increase was partially offset by changes in product and market mix, decreasing ARPU by €0.12, and unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates, decreasing Premium ARPU by €0.08.

## How We Generate Revenue

We operate and manage our business in two reportable segments - Premium and Ad-Supported. We identify our reportable segments based on the organizational units used by the chief operating decision maker to monitor performance and make operating decisions. See Note 20 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our reportable segments.

### Premium

We generate revenue for our Premium segment through the sale of subscriptions to the Subscription Offerings. The Subscription Offerings are primarily sold directly to end users. The Premium Service is also sold through partners who are generally telecommunications companies that bundle the subscription with their own services or collect payment for the stand-alone subscriptions from their end users. Premium partner subscription revenue is based on a per-subscriber rate in a negotiated partner agreement. We also bundle the Premium Service with other services and products.

### Ad-Supported

We generate revenue for our Ad-Supported segment primarily from the sale of display, audio, and video advertising delivered through advertising impressions across our music and podcast content. We generally enter into arrangements with advertising agencies that purchase advertising on behalf of their clients and we also enter into arrangements directly with some large advertisers. These advertising arrangements are typically sold on a cost-per-thousand impressions ("CPM") basis and are evidenced by an insertion order that specifies the terms of the arrangement such as the type of advertising product, pricing, insertion dates, and number of impressions or downloads in a stated period. Additionally, we generate revenue through arrangements with certain advertising automated exchanges, an internal self-serve platform, and advertising marketplace programs to distribute advertising inventory for purchase on a CPM basis.
