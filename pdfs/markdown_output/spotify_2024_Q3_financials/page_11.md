## Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments - Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7

In May 2024, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7, Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments. The amendments clarify that a financial liability is derecognized on the “settlement date,” which is when the related obligation is discharged, canceled, expired or the liability otherwise qualifies for derecognition. The amendments also clarify how to assess the contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets that include environmental, social and governance (“ESG”)-linked features and other similar contingent features, and the treatment of non-recourse assets and contractually linked instruments. In addition, the amendments require additional disclosures in IFRS 7 for financial assets and liabilities with contractual terms that reference a contingent event (including those that are ESG-linked), and equity instruments classified at fair value through other comprehensive income. The amendments will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2026, but earlier application is permitted. The Group is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments.

There are no other IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective and that are expected to have a material impact to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

### 3. Critical accounting estimates and judgments

In preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the significant judgments made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation and uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events.

The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 8.4% and (23.4)%, respectively. The Group operates in a global environment with significant operations in various jurisdictions outside Luxembourg. Accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the Group's earnings and the applicable tax rates in the jurisdictions where the Group operates.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense was €98 million. €70 million of current income tax expense was primarily related to profitability within the Group and did not reflect a €50 million excess tax benefit of share-based compensation deductions recognized in equity.
