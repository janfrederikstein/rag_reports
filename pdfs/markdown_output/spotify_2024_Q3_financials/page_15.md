Additionally, the Group has entered into certain lease agreements with approximately €40 million of commitments, which had not commenced as of September 30, 2024, and, as such, have not been recognized in the interim condensed consolidated statement of financial position.

The weighted-average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities recognized in the interim condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of September 30, 2024 was 6.4%.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Group entered into agreements to sublease a portion of its leased offices under finance leases. As an intermediate lessor, the Group accounts for sublease arrangements separately from the related lease agreements. Subleases are classified as either finance or operating leases by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease. Where the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease; all other leases are classified as operating leases. Amounts due from lessees under finance subleases are recognized as receivables discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. Below is the roll-forward of finance lease receivables:
