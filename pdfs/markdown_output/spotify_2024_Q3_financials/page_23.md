Various legal actions, proceedings, and claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted against the Group. The results of such legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the extent of the Group's financial exposure is difficult to estimate. The Group records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

As of April 2019, Spotify USA Inc.'s settlement of the Fredrik et al. v. Spotify USA Inc., No. 1:16-cv-8412-AJN (S.D.N.Y.), putative class action lawsuit, which alleged that Spotify USA Inc. unlawfully reproduced and distributed musical compositions without obtaining licenses, was final and effective. Even with the effectiveness of the settlement, we may still be subject to claims of copyright infringement by rights holders who have purported to opt out of the settlement or who may not otherwise be covered by its terms. The Music Modernization Act of 2018 contains a limitation of liability with respect to such lawsuits. For example, in January 2019, the Rights Holders LLC, nevertheless, filed lawsuits, and may argue that they should not be bound by this limitation of liability filed on or after August 1, 2018. Eight Mile Style, LLC et al. v. Spotify USA Inc., No. 3:19-cv-00746-AJT, lawsuit was filed against Spotify USA Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, alleging both that Spotify USA Inc. does not qualify for the limitation of liability in the Music Modernization Act and that the limitation of liability is unconstitutional and, thus, not valid law. In August 2024, the court granted partial summary judgment for Spotify USA Inc. against Eight Mile Style, LLC, holding that all of Eight Mile Style’s claims are barred. Eight Mile Style has filed a notice of appeal.

The carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, restricted cash, trade and other payables, and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities. The Group measures its finance lease receivables as described in Note 7. The carrying amount of our finance lease receivables is considered to approximate their fair value at September 30, 2024.
