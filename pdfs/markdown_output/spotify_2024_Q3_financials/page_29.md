## 21. Commitments and contingencies

### Commitments

The Group is subject to the following minimum guarantees relating to the content on its Service, the majority of which relate to minimum royalty payments associated with its license agreements for the use of licensed content:

|  | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
|---|---|---|
| **Not later than one year** | 1,331 | 1,055 |
| **Later than one year but not more than five years** | 386 | 3,610 |

In addition, the Group is subject to various non-cancelable purchase obligations and service agreements with minimum spend commitments, including a service agreement with Google for the use of Google Cloud Platform and certain podcast and marketing commitments:

|  | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
|---|---|---|
| **Not later than one year** | 619 | 453 |
| **Later than one year but not more than five years** | 952 | 1,369 |
| **More than five years** | 68 | 83 |

### Contingencies

Various legal actions, proceedings, and claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted against the Group. These may include, but are not limited to, matters relating to intellectual property, data protection, consumer protection, employment, and contractual rights. As a general matter, the music and other content made available on the Group's Service are licensed to the Group by various third parties. Many of these licenses allow rights holders or other authorized parties to audit the Group's royalty payments, and any such audit could result in disputes over whether the Group has paid the proper royalties. If such a dispute were to occur, the Group could be required to pay additional royalties, and the amounts involved could be material. The Group expenses legal fees as incurred. The Group records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Group's operations or its financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

On May 16, 2024, the Mechanical Licensing Collective ("MLC"), an entity designated to administer a blanket compulsory license available under U.S. law, filed a lawsuit against Spotify USA Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (**Mechanical Licensing Collective v. Spotify USA Inc., No. 1:24-cv-03809**), alleging that beginning with its March 2024 report, Spotify USA Inc. improperly reported and underpaid royalties for its Premium Service as a bundle that includes a specified monthly allocation of audiobook access. If the MLC were entirely successful in this case, the additional royalties that would be due in relation to the period March 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024 would be approximately €94 million, plus potentially penalties and interest, which we cannot reasonably estimate. We intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit.
